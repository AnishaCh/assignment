<p>History of Internet
    The internet is a historic revolution is communication for the human race that is changing the world. It is the next big thing. It helps millions of people to connect and communicate from different corners of the world via emails, chat boxes etc. Also, it is a large market place for shopping. Internet helped people be free from the limits of time and distance. It origins back to 1950s it was the biggest invention with a very wide scope. It generated $301 billion in business and contributed towards a significant growth of the US economy. The earliest ideas regarding the global networking was given by Dr. J. C. R Licklider. In October 1957 the soviet Union launched sputnik, the president created a bureau at the defense department called ARPA, it was in charge of the space program which then involved computer science.</p>
<p>Browser Wars
    Mosaic was the first graphical web browser; the aim later was to build a new browser based on mosaic and turn the internet into the future of commerce and communication. Netscapeâ€™s launched a new web browser called navigator which was a huge success. They were huge competitors to Microsoft. Microsoft aimed to outperform and build something better than Netscape. The growth numbers for Netscape were extraordinary. Microsoft put millions of dollars into the web turning internet explorer into the next big thing. They caught the drawbacks of Netscape and took advantage of it. Despite the drawbacks of Netscape, Microsoft's internet explorer has huge advantages. Both the companies went head-to-head with various versions of browsers. Ultimately, Microsoft won the browser war. â€¢ At the start of Netscape Navigator's collapse, the corporation open-sourced their browser code, which has been later given to the newly formed Mozilla Foundation, a mostly community-driven endeavor to create a Netscape successor

    Internet Search
    Using the world wide web, without knowing how to navigate it raised an issue. Initially, finding the desired web page was challenging. There were multiple websites which led to page after page to locate the desired web page, this led to the need for web search. Initially there were a set of web pages listed and people had to search through it. Yahoo headed to become the founders of internet search. It also proved that it is possible to make money on the web , especially through advertisements. Another search startup which aimed to focus on developing a search engine is Excite. The technology that excite developed was more sophisticated than that of yahoo.Yahoo had a list of sites sorted by humans but excite was completely software based. When we type in a query the software looks for the desired pages based on the terms entered. The search initially was undesirable leading to unwanted pages based on the key words. This was a trigger for google. Google overcame this with a solution. The websites we are looking for are shown based on the counts of links i.e how many pages point to the page you are looking for. Google gave a tough competition to Yahoo and Excite. The search engine proved to be one of the world's best market search and analysis platforms. Google had a large user base, but no revenue-generating business model. Doerr conducted study into how to develop a business plan for it. Larry and Sergey did not want to include advertisements because they wanted users to enjoy using this search engine. They obtained their idea by stealing it from Bill Gross (founder, IdeaLab). They planned to sell keywords to marketers because they believed that advertisers would be prepared to pay a lot of money for keyword information. Bill Gross was scheduled to meet with Google. Google launched AdWords, a service that was comparable to Overture (the company with keyword ideas given by Bill Gross). Gross sued Google for this, but the case was resolved for a large sum of money.</p>
